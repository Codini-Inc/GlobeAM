The additional pockets of fat beneath the chin (or the submental area) can be caused by aging, genetics, or weight fluctuations that lead to a weaker jawline and chin for an undefined profile. Our team is happy to offer this revolutionary method to get rid of neck fat at The Plastics Clinic. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), KYBELLA is the first nonsurgical option for submental fat. The active component in KYBELLA is a synthetic version of deoxycholic acid that works like the natural DA in the body to break down and absorb fat cells. Once it has been injected under the chin, you can see a noticeable reduction in fat. When the fat is eliminated, the cells cannot reform so you can enjoy your new, slim neck and defined jawline for years to come.",

      additionalDescription: "KYBELLA treatments do not require anesthesia so you are allowed to leave the office when you are ready to resume your usual routine. You may notice temporary swelling, numbness, or bruising below your chin, but this should not last longer than a few days. Contact The Plastics Clinic right away if you are noticing any unusual side effects, such as difficulty swallowing, facial muscle weakness, or if your smile is uneven. While the fat cells that are eliminated do not return, the remaining cells can grow larger so you should keep a stable weight after your KYBELLA treatments to keep new pockets of fat from developing. Ideal results following this treatment leave your neck appearing tighter and slimmer, and your neckline will be more defined.",
